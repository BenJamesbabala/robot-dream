## Review of somatosensory cortex (Mouse and rat brains)

Neocortical areas are believed to be organized into vertical modules, the cortical columns, and the horizontal layers 1–6. In the somatosensory barrel cortex these columns are defined by the readily discernible barrel structure in layer 4. Information processing in the neocortex occurs along vertical and horizontal axes, thereby linking individual barrel-related columns via axons running through the different cortical layers of the barrel cortex. Long-range signaling occurs within the neocortical layers but also through axons projecting through the white matter to other neocortical areas and subcortical brain regions. Because of the ease of identification of barrel-related columns, the rodent barrel cortex has become a prototypical system to study the interactions between different neuronal connections within a sensory cortical area and between this area and other cortical as well subcortical regions. Such interactions will be described specifically for the feed-forward and feedback loops between the somatosensory and the somatomotor cortices as well as the different thalamic nuclei. In addition, recent advances concerning the morphological characteristics of excitatory neurons and their impact on the synaptic connectivity patterns and signaling properties of neuronal microcircuits in the whisker-related somatosensory cortex will be reviewed. In this context, their relationship between the structural properties of barrel-related columns and their function as a module in vertical synaptic signaling in the whisker-related cortical areas will be described.

		Tactile information relating to single whisker deflections is in part signaled via thalamocortical neurons of the ventral posterior medial nucleus (VPM) providing important input to L4 neurons. With their strong output connectivity to other cortical layers, the excitatory neurons of L4 are in a good position to distribute this sensory information to both supragranular and infragranular cortical layers within the C2 barrel column.

## Strength inputs in L2/3 (Mouse)

> Laminar patterns of excitatory and inhibitory input to L2/3 pyramidal cells derived from glutamate uncaging in vitro. Example maps of excitatory (left) and inhibitory (middle) input to pyramidal neurons. A reconstruction of the neuron’s cell body and major dendrites is shown in black or white over the color-coded input maps. The color scale codes evoked input in units of picoamperes measured after photostimulation for each stimulation site. Right: summary data of laminar excitatory (top) and inhibitory (bottom) input strength onto L2/3 pyramidal neurons **([3])**

## Delays (Mouse)
![delays](kinetics_of_uEPSPs.png)
>(A) Latency was measured from AP peak to uEPSP onset. Rise-time was measured from 20% to 80% of the peak uEPSP amplitude. Time-to-peak was measured from latency to peak. Half-width indicates the measured full-width at half-maximal response amplitude. Decay-time was the time constant obtained from a single exponential fit of 80% to 20% on the falling phase of the uEPSP.  
(B) Example experiments showing differences in uEPSP duration. An example synaptic connection between two L4 neurons (red) has a longer duration compared to a different example experiment with a synaptic connnection from a L4 neuron to a L3 neuron (blue). The traces have been scaled so that the peak of the uEPSP has the same amplitude.  
(C) Example experiments showing differences in uEPSP latency. An example synaptic connection between two L2 neurons (red) has a shorter latency than a different example experiment showing a connection from L2 to L5B (blue). The traces have been scaled so that the peak of the uEPSP has the same amplitude.  
(D) Color-coded matrix of layer specific uEPSP latencies.

# Memristive brain architecture

Starting idea of the memristive brain project: implement emotional pathways of a mammalian brain biomimetically  reproducing cortical and subcortical structures of a mammalian brain. Previously we have used "cube of emotions" by Hugo LÃ¶vheim to as the base for the emotional simulation for the reimplementation of psycho-emotional states of a mammal in a computational system, see our project [NeuCogAr](https://github.com/research-team/NEUCOGAR).
